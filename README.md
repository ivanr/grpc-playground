gRPC is a very popular framework and yet it's surprisingly difficult
to find good and comprehensive examples of all the little things that
you need to know in order to use it. I use this repo to keep track of
various techniques, documentation, and links. The idea is to have
in one place everything you need to get up and running quickly.
Java only.

The best way to use this repo is to study the code and the comments.
Additionally, take a look at [LINKS.md](LINKS.md) for documentation and references.
